# F1 Prediction Platform

Predicts Formula 1 race and sprint winners from historical and current session data, using a weighted feature-scoring model rather than a trained ML model.

## Language

### Race & Session Structure

**Race**:
The weekend-scoped entity — one row per event, covering qualifying, an optional sprint, and the Grand Prix. Matches the `races` table and the `race_id` FK used throughout the schema, including sprint tables.
_Avoid_: "Race" to mean specifically the Sunday session — say "Grand Prix" or "GP session" instead.

**Grand Prix (GP)**:
The main Sunday race session specifically, distinct from Qualifying and Sprint sessions within a Race weekend.
_Avoid_: "Race" alone when the Sunday session specifically is meant.

**Circuit**:
The static, seeded-once venue entity a Race is held at (overtake rate, safety car probability, layout data).
_Avoid_: Track — a casual synonym that leaked into a few column names historically; don't use it for new naming.

**Sprint Qualifying (SQ)**:
The session that sets the sprint grid (SQ1/SQ2/SQ3), distinct from main Qualifying. Same concept as "Sprint Shootout" — F1's 2023-only name for this session, kept in `event_format` as a year-dependent label, not a distinct concept.
_Avoid_: Sprint Shootout, except when specifically referring to the 2023 season's naming.

**Season**:
One calendar year of competition (`seasons.year`); F1 seasons never span two calendar years, so "Season" and "Year" refer to the same span of time here.
_Avoid_: Treating "Season" as a distinct span from "Year" — they're interchangeable in this domain.

**Race Status**:
The weekend's pipeline progress state (`scheduled` → `sprint_qualifying_done` → `sprint_done` → `qualifying_done` → `completed`), stored on `races.status`. Drives which ETL job runs next.
_Avoid_: Confusing with Classification — they're unrelated concepts that happen to share the column name "status" on different tables.

**Classification**:
A driver's per-session finishing result (`Finished`, `Retired`, `Disqualified`, etc.), stored on `race_results.status`/`sprint_results.status`. Feeds into DNF.
_Avoid_: "Status" alone when Classification is meant — see Race Status.

**DNF**:
Any Grand Prix classification other than finishing on the lead lap or within a lap of the leader — deliberately includes disqualifications (DSQ) and non-starts (DNS), not just mechanical/accident retirements. Counts against `dnf_rate` and `reliability_score` the same as any other non-finish. See [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-dnf-includes-dsq-and-dns.md).
_Avoid_: Treating DSQ/DNS as excluded from "DNF" — in this codebase they are not distinct categories for reliability purposes.

**Stint**:
A continuous run of laps on a single tyre Compound between pit stops. Long Run Pace (GP model) and Short Run Pace (Sprint model) are both derived from stint-level lap data — "long" vs "short" describes the session the stint came from (FP2/FP1 practice vs. Sprint Qualifying), not the stint's length.

### Prediction Model

**RuleBased (model)**:
The `weighted-v3`/`sprint-v2` approach: hand-weighted feature scores combined by a fixed formula and softmax, as opposed to a trained ML model that learns its own weights from data. Kept as a distinct term because a future ML-based predictor is a live possibility this project wants to be able to name and compare against — not merely a synonym for "the prediction model."

**Feature Score**:
One of the 12 (GP) or 8 (Sprint) normalized 0.00000–1.00000 inputs to a Prediction (e.g. "Car Performance score," "Luck Factor score"). Combined by fixed weights into `raw_weighted_score`, then softmax'd into `win_probability`.
_Avoid_: Bare "score" — always qualify with the feature name, or use "Health Score" if data quality is meant.

**Starting Position**:
The raw, unadjusted grid-position score. Shown for transparency but does not feed the weighted model directly.

**Circuit-Adjusted Starting Position**:
Starting Position scaled by the Circuit's overtake rate and safety-car probability. This is the actual GP/Sprint model feature. The same raw-vs-adjusted pairing applies to Position Gain / Circuit-Adjusted Position Gain.
_Avoid_: "Starting Position" when the circuit-adjusted (weighted) version is meant — they are numerically different scores.

**Model Version**:
A string (`weighted-v3`, `sprint-v2`, ...) identifying exactly which weight/formula revision produced a given Prediction. GP and Sprint models version independently and intentionally — they iterate on separate schedules and are never expected to share a version number or ship together.

**Prediction**:
The full, race-scoped ranked list of drivers with win probabilities and feature breakdowns — assembled from `race_predictions` (predicted winner + model version) joined with `driver_prediction_features` (per-driver scores). Not just the predicted winner.
_Avoid_: Equating "Prediction" with the `race_predictions` row alone — that table only holds the winner-pointer half of it.

### Data Operations

**Backfill**:
Bulk, range-based historical data population (e.g. `backfill_full.py`, `backfill_sprint.py`) — run once to onboard a new season, era, or table.
_Avoid_: Calling a Repair a "backfill."

**Repair**:
Targeted re-ingestion of data for specific `fixable` issues flagged by a `data_quality_audit` run, followed by recomputing the affected features/predictions/season stats. Scoped to flagged gaps, not a year range.

**Health Score**:
A 0–100 data-completeness metric produced by the data quality audit (`data_quality_runs.health_score`) — unrelated to Feature Scores and to a driver's chance of winning anything.
_Avoid_: Bare "score" — this and Feature Score share no scale or meaning despite the name.
