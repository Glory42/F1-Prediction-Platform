"""
Backfill sprint race data for seasons that contain sprint weekends.

For each year this script:
  1. Re-syncs the schedule to populate qualifying_date / sprint_date / event_format
  2. For every completed sprint round runs:
       ingest_sprint_qualifying → compute_sprint_features → compute_sprint_predictions
       → ingest_sprint → (compute_season_stats once at the end)

Usage:
    python backfill_sprint.py [--years 2025 2026]
    python backfill_sprint.py --years 2026          # single year
